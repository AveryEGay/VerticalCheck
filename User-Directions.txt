This is a program to easily be able to check the vertical sensor on CertainTeed frames. Here are
the steps that you should take to use this program effectively:

1. Go to the POC screen and open TeraTerm (There will be a Desktop icon for it.)

2. Within TeraTerm go to File -> Log.

3. Change the output location to your preference and name the file anything,
	BUT BE SURE IT ENDS IN .log, then click Save.

4. Within the TeraTerm window type the command VTS. (You won't be able to see the VTS when you
	type it in, but it is there.) After typing VTS, click the ENTER key on the keyboard.

5. You will see data in the TeraTerm window. Exit out of the TeraTerm window and find the .log
	file that you saved from step 3. Open this .log file and make sure there is data in the 
	file.

6. Remote into the POC and retrieve the .log file by placing it on your local computer.

7. Open the VerticalCheck.exe program and click on the "Browse" button and click the .log file
	that you placed on your local computer.

8. Click the "Create Plot and Output File" button. This will show a plot of the vertical scan
	as well as create a Vertical-Formatted.log file in the same folder as the VerticalCheck.exe
	program.

9. Disregarding any drops at the beggining of the profile, see that there is no more than 
	100 um of range in the profile.
